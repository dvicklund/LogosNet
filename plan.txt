The program will accept an arbitrary number of connections and receive/send 
messages according to whether the client is a "participant" or "observer.  
It is essentially a chat program that has two different types of clients.
Users will input their username, to be displayed before each mesasge that 
they send, so others will know who sent it.  The server will broadcast all
messages to all participants and observers as soon as they are received.

Most challenging issue will be implementing the "select" logic and dealing
with a great number of open clients.  That will be difficult to test, as it 
will require several open terminal windows and will be necessarily time consuming.

Resources will include Google (for documentation and examples),
professor's office hours, and discussing strategies with classmates.

Plan is to meet weekly or more often and implement, in the following order:

1. Demo code
2. Argument parsing
3. Packet protocols
4. Connection observer/participant determination
5. Unique username logic / 10s timeout
6. Select() multiple connection handling
7. Observer / participant association
8. Type /quit to exit
9. Public / private message logic
